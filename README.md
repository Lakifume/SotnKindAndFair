# KindAndFair

Balance mod for retro Castlevania games including new randomization options.
Currently supports Symphony of the Night and Harmony of Dissonance

Initially built for a friend who seeked greater challenge in Symphony of the Night this program aims to give replayability and balance to some of the popular Castlevania randomizers. The changes focus mostly on enemies by using a system that will provide playthroughs with a difficulty scale that you'd expect based on the settings chosen. Global intensity level can be adjusted to preference.

To use simply randomize your rom with the regular rando first and then run it through this program.

If you intend to use any other hacks make sure to apply them either beforehand or using this program (by dropping the ips files in the Data\\{GAME}\Patches folder), avoid applying extra patches after running KindAndFair. Note that patches used via this program get applied in alphabetical order.
